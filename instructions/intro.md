# How the project works
- While each student will have his/her own project, I encourage all students to work togeher as much as possible to share the common work such as data collection.
- You will **need to be proactive**, especially if you want a good grade:
  - I will provide general directions, but not step-by-step instructions (you will need to figure these out);
  - Such as finding relevant papers, coming up with new design idea, and exploring implementation options;
  - I am always here to help if you have any question or difficulty: **ask as soon as you can if something is not clear or you got stuck. Don't wait for the next meeting.**
- Have a look of the **previous student projects**:
  - Someone has worked on your topic already; you don't need to start from scratch.
- We will have weekly meetings:
  - In person or online;
  - We will go through each project at the meeting (we may need to split into groups if the meeting gets too long);
  - You need to **update your progress** since last meeting and discuss any questions/difficulties;
  - **Set the tasks** before next meeting.

## Project planning and management
- For 25-26, the plan is to trial replacing [GitHub Issues and Projects](https://github.com/features/issues) with [MS Planner](https://planner.cloud.microsoft) in Teams
- This is potentially easier than GitHub Issues and Projects.
- Will be used for meeting notes as well as mentioned earlier.
- You can still use Issues and Projects for example for more complex coding issues.

## ~~Issues:~~
~~Todo list/tasks and coding issue~~
- ~~Each 'issue' is a task to complete (action from the meeting)~~
- ~~Assign an issue to the person that is responsible~~

## ~~Projects~~
~~Planning and project management (we will come back to this for Project Plan/Proposal)~~
- ~~You can create a kanban board in 'project' (similar to Trello)~~
- ~~create "milestones', e.g., one for each iteration~~
- ~~add 'issues' to 'milestones', and set deadline~~
- ~~**An overly detailed example**: [this project template](https://github.com/users/kaidatavis/projects/2)~~
- ~~You don't need to use GitHub Project, but **some form of project planning and progress tracking is essential**.~~
