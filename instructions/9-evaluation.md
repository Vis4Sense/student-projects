# Evaluation/Feedback

When to get feedback?
- After the completion of the paper prototype/wireframe (less formal)
- After the completion of the MVP (less formal)
- After the completion of the final protoytpe (more formal)

How to get feedback and evaluate 
- It is not that different from the requirement gathering, except user would use what you produced.
- For the wireframe, you need to help user imaging how the app would work
  - Figma 'interaction mockup' will be useful here
- For MVP, help participants focus on the core functionalities, not the missing/less important ones (such as user account)
- For the final prototype, it will be a proper evaluation (vs. feedback)
  - More participants: 5+ (10+ for statistical analysis)
  - Clearly defined task(s): maybe more complex so takes longer to complete
  - More detailed notes/recording: may record the session, including interviews
  - More detailed analysis afterwards: qualitative (such as thematic analysis) and/or quantitative (such as t-test or anova analysis).

The simplest form for the interface usability evaluation is probably to use standard questionaires such as [SUS and NASA-TLX](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measuring-perceived-usability/).
