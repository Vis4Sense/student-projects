## User requirements
- What users to find:  
  - Find users your work targets, not just your family and friends (sometimes they are the targeted users).
  - An alternative is company/organisation/charity that work with real users (they can get you in contact with the users).
  - A few would be fine, and the more the better.
- Requirements 
  - Get the requirements from the **real users**, not what you think: you might not know what users wants, unless you are a targeted user.
  - Focus on the **target use case**, i.e., the problem that the users will use your solution for. There can be many other related tasks, but these are out of the scope
  - The requirements should be about the **problems** or **challenges**, not the technology or solution
    - For example, 'I cannot create the prompt for chatGPT to generate the text I want' instead of 'I want a prompt autocomplete feature when using the chatGPT web interface'.
  - How to get requirements
    - Recruite some users
    - Collection demographic information such as their gender, age group, education background, student/working, experience/familarity with the topic, etc.
    - Observe how they complete the task you want to support, focusing on the **problems** and **challenges**.
      - Have a pre-prepared task and dataset usually works better
    - Talk to the users afterwards for clarification (e.g., why did you do this?) and comments (e.g., what was the most difficult part?)
      - Prepare a few open-ended questions: not just 'yes' or 'no' answer
      - Questions about what happened in the session
    - Take notes during the observation and interview.
    - Analyse the notes to come up with the list of requirements.
- There are a few talks on ['How to Talk to Users'] by [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) a very successful startup incubator (airbnb, dropbox, stripe, etc.)
