# Design

Paper prototype/wireframe tool: 
- Pencil and paper
- Low fidelity: PowerPoint, [Miro](https://miro.com/) (recommended), or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
- High fidelity: ***Figma*** (recommended) https://www.figma.com
  - Free (until Adobe starts to charge for it)
  - Web-based: easy to share with other, and allow co-editing and comments
  - Support advanced feature such as 'interaction mockup': user can click a box (that looks like a button) and a new screen is displayed (by loading another wireframe)
  - The [official tutoral](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/4405269443991-Figma-for-Beginners-tutorial-4-parts-) and there are also many on YouTube like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJOSK4gXl4).
