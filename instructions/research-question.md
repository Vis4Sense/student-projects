Things to include when defining a research question (using design a tool to support literature review as an example)

1. Target user: as much detail as possible, especially those related to the research question, such as if the user is an expert on the literature review topic, if not how far away is the user's expertise from the topic.
2. Usage scenrio:
    1. What the user tries to achieve: for literature review, this can be finding out the latest technique for a particular problem, keep updated on a research area, or writing a survey paper (on a specific topic).
        1. This relates to the user profile: it is unlikely that an user would write a survey paper on a topic he/she is not familiar with.    
    1. What are the constraints: is there a time limit, does user have access to all the information, etc.
3. Best available solutions:
    1. What are these
    2. What is still missing: is this just programming efforst or needs a new technique?
4. The idea (hypothesis):
    1. What is it?
    2. How will it address the issue/improve the best available solution?
    3. What benefits it will bring to the users?
5. Evaluation:
    1. Is it possible to measure the benefit of the new solution?
    2. If not, how to demonstrate the benefit of the new solution?
    3. If yes, can you compare it to the best available solution?
