2. Usage scenrio:
    1. What the user tries to achieve: for literature review, this can be finding out the latest technique for a particular problem, keep updated on a research area, or writing a survey paper (on a survey topic).
    1. What are the constraints: is there a time limit, does user have access to all the information, etc.
