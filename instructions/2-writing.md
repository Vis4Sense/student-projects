# Writing

## Markdown
If you never used markdown before, [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) can get you started. 

It is similar to HTML, but much simpler. `readme.md` is a markdown file with `.md` extension.

Visual studio code [support this natively](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown), and you can use extension like [markdown all in one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) to easily turn markdown into a pdf.

## Latex (instead of Word)
Recommended: Use Latex instead of Word for all the reports: proposal, progress report, final report, and viva.
- This will 
  - make your report look more professional
  - make the references easier
  - **This is a must if you want of publish the project**: this is how many academic papers and books are written
- Recommended editor: Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/), like Google Docs for Latex.
  - Overleaf has a ['visual editor' mode](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_use_Overleaf%3F), which makes it similar to how you would write in Word.
  - **University of Nottingham has paid overleaf subscription**: just register with your university email.

- It is possible to [use Markdonw in Latex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Writing_Markdown_in_LaTeX_Documents), which can be a bit verbose.
