# Student Projects
Repository for all the student projects, including UG/PGT final projects and intern projects.

## [How the project works](instructions/intro.md)

## Project topics
- Please see the background and possible ideas [on my website](https://kaixu.me/projects/).
- We will need to further narrow down the scope for your project:
  - I will help you do this;
  - We will define the work for each student if there are more than one working on the same project.  
- **You will get 80+ mark if the project results can be published in a good conference or journal**;
  - This is not a requirement and it will need more work than projects not trying to publish.  
  - If you want to do this, please **read at least one paper from beginning to end** (listed on the project idea webpage). 
    - **This will take a long time (at least a few days)**. There will be many things you never heard of and not explained in the paper, so you need a lot of extra research to understand them.
    - **The worst part is that this is often recursive**, i.e., you need to read other equally difficult papers to understand the current paper.
  - Figure out what the research question is, and narrow down yours in a similar way;
  - **Find a target paper** (whihc is probably not be first you read)
    - This the **baseline for your comparison**, so you can show the improvement brought by your work;
    - Copy the process from requirements, design, implementation, to evaluation for your project. This is the way usually how these are done.
