# Student Projects
Repository for all the student projects, including UG/PGT final projects and intern projects.

## How the project works
- While each student will have his/her own project, I encourage all students to work togeher as much as possible to share the common work such as data collection.
- You will **need to be proactive**, especially if you want a good grade:
  - I will provide general directions, but not step-by-step instructions (you will need to figure these out);
  - Such as finding relevant papers, coming up with new design idea, and exploring implementation options;
  - I am always here to help if you have any question or difficulty: **ask as soon as you can if something is not clear or you got stuck. Don't wait for the next meeting.**
- Have a look of the **previous student projects**:
  - Someone has worked on your topic already; you don't need to start from scratch.
- We will have weekly meetings:
  - In person or online;
  - We will go through each project at the meeting (we may need to split into groups if the meeting gets too long);
  - You need to **update your progress** since last meeting and discuss any questions/difficulties;
  - **Set the tasks** before next meeting.

## Project topics
- Please see the background and possible ideas [on my website](https://kaixu.me/projects/).
- We will need to further narrow down the scope for your project:
  - I will help you do this;
  - We will define the work for each student if there are more than one working on the same project.  
- **You will get 80+ mark if the project results can be published in a good conference or journal**;
  - This is not a requirement and it will need more work than projects not trying to publish.  
  - If you want to do this, please **read at least one paper from beginning to end** (listed on the project idea webpage). 
    - **This will take a long time (at least a few days)**. There will be many things you never heard of and not explained in the paper, so you need a lot of extra research to understand them. **The worst part is that this is often recursive**, i.e., you need to read other equally difficult papers to understand the current paper.
  - Figure out what the research question is, and narrow down yours in a similar way;
  - **Find a target paper** (whihc is probably not be first you read)
    - This the **baseline for your comparison**, so you can show the improvement brought by your work;
    - Copy the process from requirements, design, implementation, to evaluation for your project. This is the way usually how these are done.

## Ethics
1. Preliminary ethics form: to decide if you need to submit the full ethics form
2. Full eithics form (most of you will need to): for this you will need
   - recruitment materials
   - information sheet
   - consent form
   - privacy notice
1. Data Management Plan (DMP)
2. More details on the [webpage](https://uniofnottm.sharepoint.com/sites/ComputerScienceResearchEthicsResources).

## Design
Paper prototype/wireframe tool: 
- Pencil and paper
- Low fidelity: PowerPoint or Balsamiq https://balsamiq.com/
- High fidelity: ***Figma*** (recommended) https://www.figma.com
  - Free (until Adobe starts to charge for it)
  - Web-based: easy to share with other, and allow co-editing and comments
  - Support advanced feature such as 'interaction mockup': user can click a box (that looks like a button) and a new screen is displayed (by loading another wireframe)
  - The [official tutoral](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/4405269443991-Figma-for-Beginners-tutorial-4-parts-) and there are also many on YouTube like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJOSK4gXl4).

## Evaluation/Feedback

When to get feedback?
- After the completion of the paper prototype/wireframe (less formal)
- After the completion of the MVP (less formal)
- After the completion of the final protoytpe (more formal)

How to get feedback and evaluate 
- It is not that different from the requirement gathering, except user would use what you produced.
- For the wireframe, you need to help user imaging how the app would work
  - Figma 'interaction mockup' will be useful here
- For MVP, help participants focus on the core functionalities, not the missing/less important ones (such as user account)
- For the final prototype, it will be a proper evaluation (vs. feedback)
  - More participants: 5+ (10+ for statistical analysis)
  - Clearly defined task(s): maybe more complex so takes longer to complete
  - More detailed notes/recording: may record the session, including interviews
  - More detailed analysis afterwards: qualitative (such as thematic analysis) and/or quantitative (such as t-test or anova analysis).
