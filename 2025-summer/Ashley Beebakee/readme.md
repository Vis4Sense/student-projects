## A User-Configurable Deep Learning Framework for Automated Cryptocurrency Market Prediction Using Multilingual LLM-Based Sentiment Fusion
<ul>
<li>This dissertation builds upon a recurring MSc project theme offered annually within the School of Computer Science, which focuses on financial prediction using AI and sentiment analysis.</li>
<li>While prior iterations explored various architectures and sentiment techniques, this project introduces a novel contribution through the development of a fully modular, user-configurable deep learning framework that integrates multilingual LLM-based sentiment fusion for cryptocurrency market forecasting.</li>
</ul>
