## 24th April 2025 (11:00 - 12:00)
Discussion:
<ul>
  <li>Introduction between supervisor and each student talking about their MSc dissertation topic.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with writing up a dissertation based on BSc experience.</li>
  <li>Overview of deadlines and Kai Xu project dashboard.</li>
  <li>Review of coureswork and exam dates to schedule our next meeting.</li>
</ul>
Actions:
<ul>
  <li>Read existing work on 'LLM for Automated Trading' on kaixu.me to come up with somewhat of an idea.</li>
</ul>

## 9th June 2025 (13:00 - 14:30)
Discussion:
<ul>
  <li>Sentiment analysis already has quite high accuracy.</li>
  <li>Technical analysis has room for additional work to be done.</li>
  <li>Proposed idea is for the user to have freedom in blending the configuration for sentiment and technical analysis (with model settings) and be presented with visual results for comparison on training completion.</li>
</ul>
Actions:
<ul>
  <li>Perform a sample test on whether the extraction of multilingual sentiment from a variety of sources may be beneficial for sentiment analysis.</li>
  <li>Read Manasi Mehta's dissertation in more detail to synthesise a robust project proposal.</li>
  <li>Reach completion on the given tasks issued by Kai Xu on the '2025-summer' readme.md file.</li>
</ul>

## 16th June 2025 (13:00 - 14:00)
Discussion:
<ul>
  <li>Reviewed sample test for multilingual sentiment analysis and model that was utilised.</li>
  <li>User to configure different classification models, each one consisting of their respective settings.</li>
  <li>"Full Ethics" declaration form may require submission if human participants are required to test my project (without needing their personal details).</li>
</ul>
Actions:
<ul>
  <li>Populate GitHub issue on multilingual sentiment analysis and perform a closure of the issue.</li>
  <li>Create project proposal draft with defined, specific tasks, i.e. types of features and techniques to be implemented.</li>
  <li>Investigate existing work of configurable interfaces: ML model or simulation (i.e. weather forecast).</li>
  <li>Create GitHub issue for “Preliminary Ethics” form, followed by submission by 18th June, 15:00.</li>
  <li>Create GitHub issue for “Full Ethics” form.</li>
  <li>Create GitHub issue for “Project Proposal”.</li>
  <li>Draft a Gantt chart for the project proposal to visualise whether complexity of project is doable within the implementation time frame.</li>
</ul>

## ~23rd June 2025 (13:00 - 14:00)~

## 30th June 2025 (13:00 - 13:45)
Discussion:
<ul>
  <li>Discussed the Project Plan leading to current work on tasks.</li>
  <li>Explained why Streamlit was chosen to implement the GUI.</li>
  <li>Checked available VRAM for AMD RX6600 XT GPU, should be able to run an LLM locally.</li>
  <li>Discussed O'Reilly course for Prompt Engineering relevancy to Work Package 1 (WP1).</li>
</ul>
Actions:
<ul>
  <li>Continue to learn about Prompt Engineering and create templates for free-to-use LLM APIs.
  <li>Begin drafting the Literature Review on any research done (i.e. Prompt Engineering, Configurable Interfaces, etc.).</li>
  <li>Create the 'base' workflow to test functionality of the system (to be expanded as the weeks pass).</li>
</ul>
Suggestions:
<ul>
  <li>Do not spend too much on learning Prompt Engineering to avoid delayed implementation of subsequent tasks</li>
</ul>
