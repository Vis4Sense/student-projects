# LLM for Natural-Language Product Discovery

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve product discovery on e-commerce platforms. Instead of keyword search, users can describe their needs in natural language, and the browser extension will find, extract, and highlight relevant product data in real time.
